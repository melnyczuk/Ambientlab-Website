**These Pages Fall Like Ash** is an immersive fiction, woven between the pages of a very unconventional book and a digital text that you conjure as you walk the streets around you.

_In an unknown city, a woman is grieving without understanding why. Part of her life has been taken from her, and she glances into alleyways and windows, searching for a moment she cannot remember._

_A street away from you now, a man wanders past architecture alien to his eyes. He can glimpse his wife in his mind’s eye, but the detail of her face is shrouded in mist._

_Between them stands you, and the questions of a child._

**These Pages Fall Like Ash** is an immersive story told across time, place and the pages of two books. By exploring the streets and places around you, you bring books and story together to create an experience that is unique to you but also shared with thousands of others.

The experience lasts as long as you want - a few hours, a day, or a week or more. It pins itself to the world around you, responding to the place in which you find yourself. You’ll walk familiar streets and see them with new eyes. You’ll dance between two worlds, and go on a journey with strangers, who will become familiar friends.

_‘..feeling mildly paranoid, reading about a city you can only see out of the corner of your eye when you’re not looking for it and not being quite sure what city I was in. There was a power in reading a story in those settings.’_

_‘I had my eyes opened, I paused and stories came to me. I felt calm but my mind was on fire’_

“_writing that breaks our conceptions of what a text can do… from B.S. Johnson’s The Unfortunates to House Of Leaves to These Pages Fall Like Ash and everything in between_”
