title: Framework
---

Each of our projects can (mechanically) be thought of in two ways.

1. They are built on a technical framework that recognises details that are specific to each reader’s location - this can be the weather, the time of day, a location chosen (or that’s been guided to) by the reader, or any other aspect of your digital presence, and then layers story into that space.

2. They accord to design dimensions that govern the way we build that story. These include the degree of Performance we ask of each participant, how we employ Movement, the way the Textual Space in which you’re reading impacts on the experience, the extent to which the whole thing is Unpredictable (or not) and a series of other, contingent considerations that shape the reader’s experience.

Taken together, these form the basis for each project. We try to make our technology repeatable, so we’re not designing from the ground up each time, and those affordances are scalable - a project that leans heavily into an Unpredictable space will be designed and experienced differently to one that doesn’t.

Importantly, we share those frameworks with you. There aren’t any secrets to what we do, and it’s not governed by a set of NDAs. We’re interested in what you can bring to this space with our help, and the best way to achieve that is to share ideas and principles as freely as possible.
