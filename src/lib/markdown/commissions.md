We make our own projects, and we also make work for clients. Some of these are included in the Projects section of this site.

There are writers and developers that we work with on a regular basis, exploring ideas and testing notions designed to bring those ideas to life. Sometimes those ideas become fully fledged projects (From Bitter Ground began life as a random thought about a book arriving unprompted in the mail), and some end up in other pieces of work. We know that manipulating the environment around a reader can lean into the uncanny, toward works that unsettle their audience, and while those are a certain starting point, the affordances of this form extend to a range of genres and story forms. We’ve made work that spans a broad spectrum of narrative styles and are always up for a new challenge.

Moreover though, we can create experiences that bring readers to your work - as tasters for a book, or to accompany a larger campaign. We’ll work with your team to realise the most valuable and innovative solution.

We can also create immersive experiences out of whole cloth, crafting a project from start to finish.

We typically work on a project pricing basis - the quote you get will be the price we work to. Smaller projects can be finished in a few months, larger works will take longer.

We can work with writers, designers, composers, marketing teams, and even publishers. If you’re interested in what we do, and what we can do for you, then [get in touch](mailto:tom@ambientlit.com).
