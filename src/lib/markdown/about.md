Ambient Literature is best described as immersive literary experiences that use a digital device to convey stories. The form relies on the presence of its reader to activate the narrative.

Or, put another way, Ambient Literature is a reflective mode of storytelling, in that it is placed in the reader’s reality, and then asks to change aspects of it. It might reveal things that were hidden, or absent; it might bridge geographical distance to bring home a truth; it will try to be invisible, and can only be understood whilst inside it.

Or, maybe this: Ambient Literature manipulates your environment, usually by digital means. Ambient Literature works suggests that story is present in the world around you, and then allows you to experience that story as you navigate the work you’re participating in.

If that’s interesting, then the Project pages on this site explore the work we’ve made of the last few years.

If none of that makes sense, then try this:

_We make immersive experiences. We place readers inside a story, and use data and other cues from your environment to conjure a narrative for each person. We use audio, text, place and presence to bring these to life._
