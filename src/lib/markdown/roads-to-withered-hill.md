**Roads to Withered Hill** is an immersive audio companion to David Barnett’s novel **Withered Hill**.

_Stood on a busy road, as the last notes of the musical score fade in your ears, you glance down at your phone, just as the voice that guided you here told you to. Overlaid over the map of the city you’ve walked through is a village that doesn’t exist. It doesn’t exist, but you know you’ve just walked around its border, learned some of its secrets, and in a moment you might be tempted to purchase the book whose mysteries it has inducted you into._

To help promote the book, we worked with Barnett and the Canelo team to produce an immersive audio experience like no other – one that transports you to Withered Hill no matter where you are in the world.

Taking the form of an audio walk, **Roads to Withered Hill** begins wherever you find yourself. It draws you into the eponymous village, tightening around you like a snare with every step. The whole experience is narrated by a mysterious voice, one that seems to know far too much about the nature of **Withered Hill** and the secrets the village protects.
