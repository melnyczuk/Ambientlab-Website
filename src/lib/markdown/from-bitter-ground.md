**From Bitter Ground** is an immersive fiction for two readers, separated by geography and tied together by story.

_As this begins, you will be asked to conjure a house from nothing._

_While the war to end all wars rages, a Belgian soldier stumbles through the gas-drenched trenches and into the doorway of a suburban house._

_A century later, a woman considers a drop of water about to descend from a leaf. She has been inside the house, and knows what awaits you._

_You will cut the air around and through your house. In time, you will enter in._

**From Bitter Ground** weaves a story between the printed page, a building that cannot possibly exist, and your presence within the whole work. The whole experience lasts four days, with a prologue accessible prior to the experience beginning.

The work foregrounds the connection between material books and an immaterial experience. Each element contributes to the whole narrative, producing a location responsive immersive work whose location is designed and determined by each reader.
