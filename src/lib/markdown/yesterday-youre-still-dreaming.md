**Yesterday You’re Still Dreaming** takes the form of an audio file delivered by smartphone, and an accompanying wrapped package.

The work can take place in any urban location, and requires approximately twenty minutes to complete. Within it, narration, reflection, and nested storytelling combine to produce a disorienting experience, the conclusion of which - the relevance of the package the participant has been carrying since the start - is an uncontrolled event in the experience.

Participants are given no instruction as to when to open the wrapped item, merely that it should take place ‘when the time feels right’. The relevance of this package to the narrative experience is only made clear at the conclusion of the work, and constitutes an experiment to illustrate the extent to which a reader will manufacture a personal connection to a random sequence of words, a kind of exploded steganographic trigger.
